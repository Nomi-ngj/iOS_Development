## What is Localization?

Localization is the process of adapting your app to different languages and regions.

### Benefits:
- Reach more users globally.
- Improve user experience by providing content in their preferred language.


## Adding Localized Strings

You can use `.strings` files or String Catalogs for localization.

### Example:

```swift
let welcomeMessage = NSLocalizedString("welcome_message", comment: "Welcome message shown on home screen")
```

**en.lproj/Localizable.strings**
```
"welcome_message" = "Welcome!";
```

**ar.lproj/Localizable.strings**
```
"welcome_message" = "Ù…Ø±Ø­Ø¨Ø§!";
```

## Using String Catalogs

String Catalogs offer a modern, GUI-based approach introduced in Xcode.

### Steps:
1. Select your `.strings` file.
2. Choose Editor > Export For Localization.
3. Edit `.xliff` or use the GUI directly in Xcode.

### Pros:
- Easier pluralization and format handling.
- Less error-prone than raw `.strings`.

## Switching Languages for Testing

1. Go to **Edit Scheme** > **Options**.
2. Set the App Language and Region.

You can also simulate locale changes using launch arguments.

```swift
UserDefaults.standard.set(["ar"], forKey: "AppleLanguages")
```

## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility ensures your app is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities.

---

## Adding Accessibility Support

Use UIKit and SwiftUI APIs to add accessibility labels, traits, and hints.

### UIKit Example:

```swift
label.accessibilityLabel = "Welcome"
label.accessibilityHint = "Displays a welcome message"
```

### SwiftUI Example:

```swift
Text("Welcome")
    .accessibilityLabel("Welcome")
    .accessibilityHint("Displays a welcome message")
```

---

## VoiceOver and Dynamic Type

Support for VoiceOver includes proper labeling and structuring of UI elements. Dynamic Type ensures your app scales fonts with system preferences.

### Enable Dynamic Type:

```swift
label.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true
```

> ğŸ“˜ Tip: Use Accessibility Inspector in Xcode to test your UI.
